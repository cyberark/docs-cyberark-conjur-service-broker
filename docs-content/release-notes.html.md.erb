These are release notes for CyberArk Conjur Service Broker for VMware Tanzu

## <a id="ver"></a> v1.2.0

**Release Date:** August 7, 2020

Features in this release:

* Improved service-broker validation and error handling
  <br/>
  - Service broker returns 404 when the org or space policy branches do not exist
    as expected with a helpful error message, rather than returning 500.
  - If a value is given to the `CONJUR_POLICY` environment variable, service-broker 
    verifies that the given policy exists on the server, and provides a helpful error 
    if it does not exist.

* Expanded buildpack configuration capabilities 
  <br/>
  - The runtime location for `secrets.yml` can now be configured by setting the
    `SECRETS_YAML_PATH` environment variable for the Cloud Foundry application.
  - Buildpack supply step now scans build directory for candidate `secrets.yml` files,
    and reports them to the buildpack deploy output during the supply phase. If unable to
    locate any `secrets.yml` files, it will exit. 

* The buildpack now properly reads only the Conjur credentials from VCAP_SERVICES. Previously, it   
  could consume credentials for other services, if their field names exactly matched those used by 
  Conjur (e.g. version is a very common field).

Known issues in this release: No known issues.
