#### Application Host Identities

When using application host identities (**Enable Spaced-scoped App Identities** is not checked), the host API
key may be rotated by simply re-binding the application to the Conjur service:

```sh
cf unbind-service <app-name> conjur
cf bind-service <app-name> conjur
```

> **NOTE:** This issues a new identity to the application, not just a new API key,
> so any application specific permissions will need to be granted again. Any permissions
> granted to the org or space layers is automatically inherited by the new identity.

#### Space Host Identities

Rotating the host API key when Space Host Identities are enabled (**Enable Spaced-scoped App Identities** is checked)
requires coordinating the host credential update with all apps in a space.

1. Rotate the Space Host API key using the Conjur CLI. This will return the new API key for the host:

    ```sh
    conjur host rotate_api_key --host <cf policy root>/<org-guid>/<space-guid>

    # for example
    $ conjur host rotate_api_key --host cf/prod/6b40649e-331b-424d-afa0-6d569f016f51/72a928f6-bf7c-4732-a195-896f67bd1133
    1p9c5443sy1bg93ek2e062wsnmvy3p9k9j83nq841sj1sp2vasze1r
    ```

2. Update the Space API key secret in Conjur:

    ```
    conjur variable values add "<cf policy root>/<org-guid>/<space-guid>/space-host-api-key" "<api-key-value>"

    # For example:
    conjur variable values add "cf/prod/6b40649e-331b-424d-afa0-6d569f016f51/72a928f6-bf7c-4732-a195-896f67bd1133/space-host-api-key" "1p9c5443sy1bg93ek2e062wsnmvy3p9k9j83nq841sj1sp2vasze1r"
    ```

3. Re-bind each application in the space to Conjur

    > This will provide the updated credentials to each application

    ```sh
    cf unbind-service <app-name> conjur
    cf bind-service <app-name> conjur
    ```
4. Re-stage each application in the space

    > This causes each app to retrieve its secrets using the rotated credentials

    ```
    cf restage <app-name>
    ```
